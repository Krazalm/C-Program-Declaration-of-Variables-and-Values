# C++ Program: Declaration of Variables and Values

This repository contains a simple C++ program that demonstrates the declaration of variables with their corresponding data types and initialization values. The program outputs the variable names along with their respective values.

## Variables and Data Types:
- **Number**: Integer (`int`)
- **Letter**: Character (`char`)
- **Result**: Boolean (`bool`)
- **Float**: Floating-point number (`float`)

## Initial Values:
- **Number**: 10
- **Letter**: 'a'
- **Result**: `true`
- **Float**: 3.14

## Program Structure:
- The program declares the variables and initializes them with the provided values.
- It then outputs the variable names and their respective values using `cout`.

## Files in this Repository:
- `surname_3_2.cpp`: Contains the C++ program showcasing variable declaration and output.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different variable types and values!
