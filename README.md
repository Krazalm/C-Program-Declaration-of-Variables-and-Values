# C-Program-Declaration-of-Variables-and-Values

This repository contains a simple C++ program that demonstrates the declaration of variables with their corresponding data types and initialization values. The program outputs the variable names along with their respective values.

Variables and Data Types:
Number: Integer (int), initialized to 10
Letter: Character (char), initialized to 'a'
Result: Boolean (bool), initialized to true
Float: Floating-point number (float), initialized to 3.14
Program Structure:
The program declares the variables and initializes them accordingly.
It then outputs the variable names and their respective values using cout.
File Structure:
surname_3_2.cpp: Contains the C++ program showcasing variable declaration and output.
Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different variable types and values!
